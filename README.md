# LORTSpellChecker

The program counts the words in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkein and finds the most occured words in the whole trilogy. 

The program also spell checks the whole trilogy and reports how many mis-spelled words are there in the three books.

Using proximity searching, the program also finds who is the most closely associated character to the Ring. Who really wants the "Ring"?
